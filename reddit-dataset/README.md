# Reddit Comment and Thread Datas

Around 260,000 threads / comments scraped from Reddit. Useful dataset for NLP projects.

## Quick Start

Scraped using [omega-red](http://github.com/linanqiu/omega-red)

The `.csv`s are named `<metareddit>_<subreddit>.csv`. The headers are described here and in `headers.txt`.

Headers are:

```
text,id,subreddit,meta,time,author,ups,downs,authorlinkkarma,authorkarma,authorisgold
```

- `text`: Text of the comment / thread
- `id`: Unique reddit id for the comment / thread
- `subreddit`: Subreddit that the comment / thread belongs to
- `meta`: Metareddit that the comment / thread belongs to. Subreddits belong to metareddits. A subreddit can be `leagueoflegends`. The metareddit for that subreddit would be `gaming`, which can also include the subreddit `dota2`
- `time`: UNIX timestamp of the comment / thread
- `author`: Username of the author of the comment / thread
- `ups`: Number of upvotes the comment / thread received
- `downs`: Number of downvotes the comment / thread received
- `authorlinkkarma`: The author's link karma. [What is Link Karma?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2idfhk/what_is_link_karma/)
- `authorkarma`: The author's karma. [Reddit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) explaining karma.
- `authorisgold`: Boolean indicator for the gold status of the user. `1` for gold users, `0` for non-gold (normal) users. [Reddit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) explaining gold status.

## Original Texts

If you prefer the texts with punctuation, they are included (as the original output files from [omega-red](github.com/linanqiu/omega-red)) at [https://mega.nz/#F!NtsCGTgD!urXdXLJ6yITYdWEdWN-H1w](https://mega.nz/#F!NtsCGTgD!urXdXLJ6yITYdWEdWN-H1w)

### Threads

are in `/threads.csv` at [https://mega.nz/#F!NtsCGTgD!urXdXLJ6yITYdWEdWN-H1w](https://mega.nz/#F!NtsCGTgD!urXdXLJ6yITYdWEdWN-H1w)

Headers are:

```
'text', 'title', 'url', 'id', 'subreddit', 'meta', 'time', 'author', 'ups', 'downs', 'authorlinkkarma', 'authorcommentkarma', 'authorisgold'
```

- `text`: text of the thread
- `title`: title of the thread

Heades are (different from `threads.csv`)

```
'text', 'id', 'subreddit', 'meta', 'time', 'author', 'ups', 'downs', 'authorlinkkarma', 'authorcommentkarma', 'authorisgold'
```

- `text`: text of the comment
- `id`: unique ID of the comment

- `time`: timestamp of the thread

All text is normalized to lower case, tokenized using a TreebankTokenizer from [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural), then joined with spaces. This results in punctuation being separated from words, a desired effect.
