 [Illustration:
 Our Father which art in Heaven hallowed be thy Name

 Thus did Job continually

 There was a Man in the Land of Uz whose Name was Job. & that Man was
 perfect & upright & one that feared God & eschewed Evil & there was
 born unto him Seven Sons & Three Daughters

 The Letter Killeth The Spirit giveth Life

 It is Spiritually Discerned]




 [Illustration:
 I beheld the Ancient of Days Hast thou considered my Servant Job

 The Angel of the Divine Presence

 I shall see God

 We shall awake up

 Thou art our Father

 in thy Likeness

 When the Almighty was yet with me. When my Children were about me

 There was a day when the Sons of God came to present themselves before
 the Lord & Satan came also among them to present himself before the
 Lord]




 [Illustration:
 The Fire of God is fallen from Heaven

 And the Lord said unto Satan. Behold All that he hath is in thy Power

 Thy Sons and thy Daughters were eating & drinking Wine in their eldest
 Brothers house & behold there came a great wind from the Wilderness &
 smote upon the four faces of the house & it fell upon the young Men &
 they are Dead]





 [Illustration:
 And there came a Messenger unto Job & said The Oxen were plowing & the
 Sabeans came down & they have slain the Young Men with the Sword

 Going to & fro in the Earth & walking up and down in it

 And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

 While he was yet speaking there came also another & said

 The fire of God is fallen from the heaven & hath burned up the flocks &
 the Young Men & consumed them & I only am escaped alone to tell thee]




 [Illustration:
 Did I not weep for him who was in trouble? Was not my Soul afflicted
 for the Poor

 Behold he is in thy hand: but save his life

 Then went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord

 And it grieved him at his heart

 Who maketh his Angels Spirits & his Ministers a Flaming Fire]

 


[Illustration:
 Naked came I out of my mothers womb & Naked shall I return thither

 The Lord gave & the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the Name of the
 Lord

 And smote Job with sore Boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of
 his head]




 [Illustration:
 What! shall we receive Good at the hand of God & shall we not also
 receive Evil

 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off & knew him not they lifted
 up their voices & wept. & they rent every Man his mantle & sprinkled
 dust upon their heads towards heaven

 Ye have heard of the Patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord]




 [Illustration:
 Lo let that night be solitary & let no joyful voice come therein

 Let the Day perish wherein I was Born

 And they sat down with him upon the ground seven days & seven nights &
 none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great]




 [Illustration:
 Shall mortal Man be more Just than God? Shall a Man be more Pure than
 his Maker? Behold he putteth no trust in his Saints & his Angels he
 chargeth with Folly

 Then a Spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up]




 [Illustration:
 But he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come
 forth like gold

 Have pity upon me! Have pity upon me. O ye my friends for the hand of
 God hath touched me

 Though he slay me yet will I trust in him

 The Just Upright Man is laughed to scorn

 Man that is born of a Woman is of few days & full of trouble he cometh
 up like a flower & is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow & continueth
 not. And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one & bringest me into
 judgment with thee]




 [Illustration:
 My bones are pierced in me in the night season & my sinews take no rest

 My skin is black upon me & my bones are burned with heat

 The triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the hypocrite is but
 for a moment

 Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light & his Ministers
 into Ministers of Righteousness

 With Dreams upon my bed thou scarest me & affrightest me with Visions

 Why do you persecute me as God & are not satisfied with my flesh. Oh
 that my words were printed in a Book that they were graven with an iron
 pen & lead in the rock for ever

 For I know that my Redeemer liveth & that he shall stand in the latter
 days upon the Earth & after my skin destroy thou This body yet in my
 flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for Myself and mine eyes shall
 behold & not Another tho consumed be my wrought Image

 Who opposeth & exalteth himself above all that is called God or is
 Worshipped]




 [Illustration:
 For God speaketh once yea twice & Man percieveth it not

 In a Dream in a Vision of the Night in deep Slumberings upon the bed
 Then he openeth the ears of Men & sealeth their instruction

 That he may withdraw Man from his purpose & hide Pride from Man If
 there be with him an Interpreter One among a Thousand

 then he is gracious unto him & saith Deliver him from going down to the
 Pit I have found a Ransom

 For his eyes are upon the ways of Man & he observeth all his goings

 I am Young and ye are very Old wherefore I was afraid

 Lo all these things worketh God oftentimes with Man to bring back his
 Soul from the Pit to be enlightened with the light of the living

 Look upon the heavens & behold the clouds which are higher than thou

 If thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thou be righteous
 what givest thou unto him]




 [Illustration:
 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge

 Then the Lord answered Job out of the Whirlwind

 Who maketh the Clouds his Chariot & walketh on the Wings of the Wind

 Hath the Rain a Father & who hath begotten the Drops of Dew]




 [Illustration:
 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades or loose the bands of
 Orion

 Let there Be Light

 Let there be A Firmament

 Let the Waters be gathered together into one place & let the Dry Land
 appear

 And God made Two Great Lights Sun Moon

 Let the Waters bring forth abundantly

 Let the Earth bring forth Cattle & Creeping thing & Beast

 When the morning Stars sang together & all the Sons of God shouted for
 joy]




 [Illustration:
 Can any understand the spreadings of the Clouds the noise of his
 Tabernacle

 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud He scattereth the bright
 cloud also it is turned about by his counsels

 Of Behemoth he saith, He is chief of the ways of God Of Leviathan he
 saith, He is King over all the Children of Pride

 Behold now Behemoth which I made with thee]




 [Illustration:
 Hell is naked before him & Destruction has no covering

 Canst thou by searching find out God Canst thou find out the Almighty
 to perfection

 The Accuser of our Brethren is Cast down which accused them before our
 God day & night

 It is higher than Heaven what canst thou do It is deeper than Hell what
 canst thou know

 The Prince of this World shall be cast out

 Thou hast fulfilled the Judgment of the Wicked

 Even the Devils are Subject to Us thro thy Name. Jesus said unto them I
 saw Satan as lightning fall from Heaven

 God hath chosen the foolish things of the World to confound the wise
 And God hath chosen the weak things of the World to confound the things
 that are mighty]




 [Illustration:
 He bringeth down to the Grave & bringeth up

 we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see
 him as He Is

 When I behold the Heavens the work of thy hands the Moon & Stars which
 thou hast ordained, then I say, What is Man that thou art mindful of
 him? & the Son of Man that thou visitest him

 I have heard thee with the hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth thee

 He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also I & my Father are One

 If you had known me ye would have known my Father also and from
 henceforth ye know him & have seen him

 Believe me that I am in the Father & the Father in me He that loveth me
 shall be loved of my Father for he dwelleth in you & shall be with you

 He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father & I will love him &
 manifest myself unto him And my Father will love him & we will come
 unto him & make our abode with him

 And the Father shall give you Another Comforter that he may abide with
 you for ever Even the Spirit of Truth which the World Cannot receive

 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father & you in me & I in you

 If ye loved me ye would rejoice because I said I go unto the Father]




 [Illustration:
 Also the Lord accepted Job

 And my Servant Job shall pray for you

 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his Friends

 I say unto you Love your Enemies bless those that curse you do good to
 those that hate you & pray for those that despitefully use & persecute
 you

 That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, for he
 maketh his sun to shine on the Evil & the Good & sendeth the rain on
 the Just & the Unjust

 Be ye therefor perfect as your Father which is in heaven is perfect]




 [Illustration:
 The Lord maketh Poor & maketh Rich

 He bringeth Low & Lifteth Up

 who provideth for the Raven his Food When his young ones cry unto God.

 Every one also gave him a piece of Money

 Who remembered us in our low estate For his Mercy endureth forever]




 [Illustration:
 How precious are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of
 them

 There were not found Women fair as the Daughters of Job in all the Land
 & their Father gave them Inheritance among their Brethren

 If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there If I make my bed in Hell
 behold Thou art there]




 [Illustration:
 Great & Marvellous are thy Works Lord God Almighty

 Just & True are thy Ways O thou King of Saints

 So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning

 After this Job lived an hundred & forty years & saw his Sons & his Sons
 Sons

 even four Generations So Job died being old & full of days

 In burnt Offerings for Sin thou hast had no Pleasure]
