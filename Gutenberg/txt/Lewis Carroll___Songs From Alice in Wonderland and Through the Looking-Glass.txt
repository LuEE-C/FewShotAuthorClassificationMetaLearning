     It has been found necessary to slightly alter the original
     arrangement of the songs; "Pig and Pepper" and "Twinkle,
     twinkle, little Bat!" have been transposed, and "Hush-a-by,
     Lady" has been placed last instead of before "Queen Alice."

ALICE

WONDERLAND]

[Illustration: How doth the little Crocodile]


[Music:

    How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
    And pour the waters of the Nile
    On ev'ry golden scale!
    How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spreads his claws,
    And welcomes little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: You are old, Father William]


[Music:

    "You are old, Father William," the young man said,
      "And your hair has become very white;
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
      Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

    "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
      "I feared it might injure the brain;
    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
      Why I do it again and again."]

[Illustration]

    "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
      And have grown most uncommonly fat;
    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
      Pray, what is the reason of that?"

    "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
      "I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
      Allow me to sell you a couple."

    "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet;
    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
      Pray, how did you manage to do it?"

    "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,
      And argued each case with my wife;
    And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,
      Has lasted the rest of my life."

    "You are old," said the youth; "one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever;
    Yet you balance an eel on the end of your nose--
      What made you so awfully clever?"

    "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
      Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Twinkle, twinkle, little Bat]


[Music:

    Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
    How I wonder what you're at!
    Up above the world you fly,
    Like a tea-tray in the sky!]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Pig and Pepper]


[Music:

    "Speak roughly to your little boy,
      And beat him when he sneezes;
    He only does it to annoy,
      Because he knows it teases."
                Wow! Wow! Wow!]

    "I speak severely to my boy,
      I beat him when he sneezes;
    For he can thoroughly enjoy
      The pepper when he pleases."
                Wow! Wow! Wow!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: The Lobster Quadrille]


[Music:

    "Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail,
    "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
    See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
    They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"]

[Illustration]

    "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
    When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
    But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
    Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

    "What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied;
    "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
    The further off from England the nearer is to France--
    Then turn not pale, belov√®d snail, but come and join the dance.
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"

[Illustration]




[Illustration: 'Tis the Voice of the Lobster]


[Music:

    'Tis the voice of the lobster; I heard him declare,
    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Beautiful Soup]


[Music:

    Beautiful soup, so rich and green,
    Waiting in a hot tureen!
    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
    Soup of the ev'ning, beautiful soup!
    Soup of the ev'ning, beautiful soup!
          Beautiful soo-oop!
          Beautiful soo-oop!
    Soo-oop of the e-e-ev'ning,
          Beautiful, beautiful soo-oo-oop!]

    "Beautiful soup! Who cares for fish,
    Game, or any other dish?
    Who would not give all else for two p-
    ennyworth only of beautiful soup!
    Pennyworth only of beautiful soup!
          Beautiful soo-oop!
          Beautiful soo-oop!
    Soo-oop of the e-e-ev'ning,
          Beautiful, beautiful soo-oo-oop!"

[Illustration]

[Transcriber's Note: The hyphen at the end of the third line of the
second verse is deliberate in the original, so that "two p-"
pronounced as one syllable rhymes with "soup."]




[Illustration: The Queen of Hearts]


[Music:

    The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Who stole the Tarts]


[Music:

    They told me you had been to her,
      And mentioned me to him:
    She gave me a good character,
      But said I could not swim.

    He sent them word I had not gone
      (We know it to be true):
    If she should push the matter on,
      What would become of you?]

    I gave her one, they gave him two,
      You gave us three or more;
    They all returned from him to you,
      Though they were mine before.

    If I or she should chance to be
      Involved in this affair,
    He trusts to you to set them free,
      Exactly as we were.

    My notion was that you had been
      (Before she had this fit)
    An obstacle that came between
      Him, and ourselves, and it.

    Don't let him know she liked them best,
      For this must ever be
    A secret, kept from all the rest,
      Between yourself and me.

  SONGS FROM
  THROUGH
  THE
  LOOKING-GLASS]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Jabberwocky]


[Music:

    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

    "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch!"]

[Illustration]

    He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought--
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
      And stood awhile in thought.

    And as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came.

    One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
    He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.

    "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?--
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
      He chortled in his joy.

    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: Tweedledum and Tweedledee]


[Music:

    Tweedledum and Tweedledee
    Agreed to have a battle;
    For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
    Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

    Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
    As black as a tar barrel;
    Which frightened both the heroes so,
    They quite forgot their quarrel.]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: The Walrus and the Carpenter]


[Music:

    The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
    He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright--
    And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.]

    The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
    Had got no bus'ness to be there
      After the day was done--
    "It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun!"

    The sea was wet as wet could be,
      The sands were dry as dry.
    You could not see a cloud, because
      No cloud was in the sky:
    No birds were flying overhead--
      There were no birds to fly.

    The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
    They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
    "If this were only cleared away,"
      They said, "it would be grand!"

    "If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year,
    Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
      "That they could get it clear?"
    "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
      And shed a bitter tear.

    "O, Oysters, come and walk with us!"
      The Walrus did beseech,
    "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
      Along the briny beach:
    We cannot do with more than four,
      To give a hand to each."

    The eldest Oyster looked at him,
      But never a word he said:
    The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
      And shook his heavy head--
    Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed.

    But four young Oysters hurried up,
      All eager for the treat:
    Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
      Their shoes were clean and neat--
    And this was odd, because, you know,
      They hadn't any feet!

    Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
    And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more--
    All hopping through the frothy waves,
     And scrambling to the shore.

[Illustration]

    The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
    And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low;
    And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row.

    "The time has come," the Walrus said,
      "To talk of many things:
    Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
      Of cabbages--and kings--
    And why the sea is boiling hot--
      And whether pigs have wings."

    "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
      "Before we have our chat;
    For some of us are out of breath,
      And all of us are fat!"
    "No hurry," said the Carpenter:
      They thanked him much for that.

    "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
      "Is chiefly what we need:
    Pepper and vinegar, besides,
      Are very good indeed--
    Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
      We can begin to feed."

    "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
      Turning a little blue.
    "After such kindness, that would be
      A dismal thing to do!"
    "The night is fine," the Walrus said.
      "Do you admire the view?"

    "It was so kind of you to come!
      And you are very nice!"
    The Carpenter said nothing, but
      "Cut us another slice:
    I wish you were not quite so deaf--
      I've had to ask you twice!"

    "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
      "To play them such a trick,
    After we've brought them out so far,
      And made them trot so quick!"
    The Carpenter said nothing, but
      "The butter's spread too thick!"

    "I weep for you," the Walrus said:
      "I deeply sympathize."
    With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size,
    Holding his pocket-handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes.

    "Oh, Oysters," said the Carpenter,
      "You've had a pleasant run!
    Shall we be trotting home again?"
      But answer came there none--
    And this was scarcely odd, because
      They'd eaten every one.

[Illustration: Humpty Dumpty]


[Music:

    Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
    Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
    All the King's horses and all the King's men
    Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.]

[Illustration]

[Illustration: The Message to the Fish]


[Music:

    In winter, when the fields are white,
    I sing this song for your delight--

    In spring, when woods are getting green,
    I'll try and tell you what I mean.

    In summer, when the days are long,
    Perhaps you'll understand the song:

    In autumn, when the leaves are brown,
    Take pen and ink, and write it down.]

[Illustration]

    I sent a message to the fish:
    I told them "This is what I wish."

    The little fishes of the sea
    They sent an answer back to me.

    The little fishes' answer was
    "We cannot do it, sir, because--"

    I sent to them again to say
    "It will be better to obey."

    The fishes answered, with a grin,
    "Why, what a temper you are in!"

    I told them once, I told them twice:
    They would not listen to advice.

    I took a kettle large and new,
    Fit for the deed I had to do.

    My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
    I filled the kettle at the pump.

    Then some one came to me, and said,
    "The little fishes are in bed."

    I said to him, I said it plain,
    "Then you must wake them up again."

    I said it very loud and clear;
    I went and shouted in his ear.

    But he was very stiff and proud;
    He said, "You needn't shout so loud!"

    And he was very proud and stiff;
    He said, "I'd go and wake them, if--"

    I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
    I went to wake them up myself.

    And when I found the door was locked,
    I pulled and pushed, and kicked and knocked.

    And when I found the door was shut,
    I tried to turn the handle, but--

[Illustration: The Lion and the Unicorn]


[Music:

    The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the Crown:
    The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.
    Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;
    Some gave them plum cake, and drummed them out of town.]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: The Aged, Aged Man]


[Music:

     Tune "I give thee all, I can no more," adapted by T. MOORE
     from H. BISHOP, arranged by L. BROADWOOD.

    I'll tell thee ev'rything I can;
      There's little to relate.
    I saw an aged, aged man,
      A-sitting on a gate.
    "Who are you, aged man?" I said.
      "And how is it you live?"
    And his answer trickled through my head
      Like water through a sieve.]

    He said, "I look for butterflies
      That sleep among the wheat:
    I make them into mutton pies,
      And sell them in the street.
    I sell them unto men," he said,
      "Who sail on stormy seas;
    And that's the way I get my bread--
      A trifle, if you please."

    But I was thinking of a plan
      To dye one's whiskers green,
    And always use so large a fan
      That they should not be seen.
    So, having no reply to give
      To what the old man said,
    I cried, "Come, tell me how you live!"
      And thumped him on the head.

    His accents mild took up the tale:
      He said "I go my ways,
    And when I find a mountain rill,
      I set it in a blaze;
    And thence they make a stuff they call
      Rowlands' Macassar Oil--
    Yet two-pence-halfpenny is all
      They give me for my toil!"

    But I was thinking of a way
      To feed oneself on batter,
    And so go on from day to day
      Getting a little fatter.
    I shook him well from side to side,
      Until his face was blue:
    "Come, tell me how you live," I cried,
      "And what it is you do!"

[Illustration]

    He said, "I hunt for haddocks' eyes
      Among the heather bright,
    And work them into waistcoat-buttons
      In the silent night.
    And these I do not sell for gold
      Or coin of silv'ry shine,
    But for a copper halfpenny,
      And that will purchase nine."

    "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
      Or set limed twigs for crabs;
    I sometimes search the grassy knolls
      For wheels of Hansom-cabs!
    And that's the way" (he gave a wink)
      "By which I get my wealth--
    And very gladly will I drink
      Your honour's noble health."

    I heard him then, for I had just
      Completed my design
    To keep the Menai bridge from rust
      By boiling it in wine.
    I thanked him much for telling me
      The way he got his wealth,
    But chiefly for his wish that he
      Might drink my noble health.

[Illustration]

[Music:

    And now, if e'er by chance I put
      My fingers into glue,
    Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
      Into a left-hand shoe,
    Or if I drop upon my toe
      A very heavy weight,
    I weep, for it reminds me so
      Of that old man I used to know--
    Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
    Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
    Whose face was very like a crow,
    With eyes, like cinders, all a-glow,
    Who seem'd distracted with his woe,
    Who rocked his body to and fro,
    And muttered mumblingly and low,
    As if his mouth were full of dough;
    Who snorted like a buffalo
    That summer ev'ning, long ago,
      A-sitting on a gate!]

[Illustration]

[Illustration: Queen Alice]


[Music:

    To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,
    "I've a sceptre in hand, I've a crown on my head;
    Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,
    Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!"]

    Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
    And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
    Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea--
    And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!

    "Oh, Looking-Glass creatures," quoth Alice, "draw near!
    'Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
    'Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
    Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!"

    Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
    Or anything else that is pleasant to drink;
    Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine--
    And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!

[Illustration: The Fish Riddle]


[Music:

    1. "First, the fish must be caught."
    That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.
    "Next, the fish must be bought."
    That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.
    "Now, cook me the fish!"
    That is easy, and will not take more than a minute.
    "Let it lie in a dish!"
    That is easy, because it already is in it!

    2. "Bring it here! Let me sup!"
    It is easy to set such a dish on the table.
    "Take the dish-cover up!"
    Ah, that is so hard that I fear I'm unable!
    For it holds it like glue--
    Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:
    Which is easiest to do,
    Undish-cover the fish, or dish-cover the riddle?]

[Music:

    Hush-a-by, lady, in Alice's lap!
    Till the feast's ready we've time for a nap:
    When the feast's over we'll go to the ball--
    Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!]
